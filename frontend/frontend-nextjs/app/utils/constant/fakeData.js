Les Souffles

Ecoute plus souvent
Les Choses que les Etres
La Voix du Feu s’entend,
Entends la Voix de l’Eau.
Ecoute dans le Vent Le Buisson en sanglots :
C’est le Souffle des ancêtres.

Ceux qui sont morts ne sont jamais partis :
Ils sont dans l’Ombre qui s’éclaire
Et dans l’ombre qui s’épaissit.
Les Morts ne sont pas sous la Terre :
Ils sont dans l’Arbre qui frémit,
Ils sont dans le Bois qui gémit,
Ils sont dans l’Eau qui coule,
Ils sont dans l’Eau qui dort,
Ils sont dans la Case, ils sont dans la Foule :
Les Morts ne sont pas morts.

Ecoute dans le Vent
Le Buisson en sanglots :
C’est le Souffle des Ancêtres morts,
Qui ne sont pas partis
Qui ne sont pas sous la Terre
Qui ne sont pas morts.

 
Ceux qui sont morts ne sont jamais partis :
Ils sont dans le Sein de la Femme,
Ils sont dans l’Enfant qui vagit
Et dans le Tison qui s’enflamme.
Les Morts ne sont pas sous la Terre :
Ils sont dans le Feu qui s’éteint,
Ils sont dans les Herbes qui pleurent,
Ils sont dans le Rocher qui geint,
Ils sont dans la Forêt, ils sont dans la Demeure,
Les Morts ne sont pas morts.

Il redit chaque jour le Pacte,
Le grand Pacte qui lie,
Qui lie à la Loi notre Sort,
Aux Actes des Souffles plus forts
Le Sort de nos Morts qui ne sont pas morts,
Le lourd Pacte qui nous lie à la Vie.
La lourde Loi qui nous lie aux Actes
Des Souffles qui se meurent
Dans le lit et sur les rives du Fleuve,
Des Souffles qui se meuvent
Dans le Rocher qui geint et dans l’Herbe qui pleure.
Des Souffles qui demeurent
Dans l’Ombre qui s’éclaire et s’épaissit,
Dans l’Arbre qui frémit, dans le Bois qui gémit
Et dans l’Eau qui coule et dans l’Eau qui dort,
Des Souffles plus forts qui ont pris
Le Souffle des Morts qui ne sont pas morts,
Des Morts qui ne sont pas partis,
Des Morts qui ne sont plus sous la Terre.

Ndeup is a healing ceremony performed by the Lebous in Senegal for therapeutic purposes. The ritual is accompanied by the drums and dance of the Sabar.
The Ndeup is one of the most important rituals of animist tradition still practised today in Senegal. It takes place in the ‘Penthie’, the village square. Communities of the Lebou tribe, who lived mainly from fishing and farming, settled around the centre of this square in the pre-colonial historical centre of Dakar. ‘Penthie’ are places of life, meeting, exchange and knowledge transfer; places where disputes were negotiated and settled. The ceremony of Ndeup, passed down from generation to generation, can induce states of trance, create social connections, transmissions and feelings of belonging, helping the individual to maintain their physical and mental balance within society.`

The French were already present in Saint-Louis in 1638. The oldest French colony in Africa, Saint-Louis du Sénégal enjoyed two centuries of glory.

From 1895 to 1902, at its peak, Saint-Louis was both the capital of the Senegalese colonies and of French West Africa (Senegal, Mauritania, Sudan, Guinea and Côte d'Ivoire). It was one of the largest cities in Africa, the most politically and economically active, the most urbanised and the largest in terms of its white population. The capital of Senegal until 1957, it was also the capital of Mauritania from 1920 to 1960.
The heart of the old colonial city is located on a narrow island. The city with its old colonial buildings was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000.`

The Musée Théodore Monod d'art africain is an IFAN institution. Formerly the Institut français d'Afrique Noire (French Institute of Black Africa), founded in 1936, IFAN became the Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire (Fundamental Institute of Black Africa) in 1966. Its mission is to preserve and promote the cultural heritage of Senegal and Africa.
Registered since 1941, the collections now number over 9,000 items, according to a 2005 inventory, and cover a geographical area well beyond West Africa. Comprising masks, statues, textiles, basketwork, pottery, leather, metal and composite pieces, they are impressive in their diversity and quality.
Based on this exceptional heritage, the museum has put in place a mediation policy supported by the creation of a pedagotheque designed to develop the imagination, leadership and creativity of the youngest visitors. This programme is reinforced by collaboration with artists in a series of residencies designed to strengthen the link between historical heritage and contemporary creation.
Scientific research is supported by the organisation of a number of conferences and the creation of a documentation room available to researchers, students and artists. It is also measured by the multifaceted presence that IFAN exerts in the field of scientific research through field missions and the organisation of conferences and exhibitions.
Thanks to its magnificent collections, its educational setting and the biodiversity of its garden, the Théodore Monod Museum is a place to live and a place to meet. For families, schoolchildren and artists, it offers a serene setting in which to relax and develop.

Visual artist Viyé Diba is in dialogue with the collections of the IFAN Ch. A. Diop Théodore Monod Museum of African Art in Dakar during a three-week TALKING OBJECTS LAB residency. His work raises a number of questions. How do you reinterpret objects that bear historical, cultural and economic testimony? How can we reinterpret them to re-establish mediation between them and the people who produced them? How can we think about this appropriation of objects in the context of the religious facts that structure the life of contemporary Senegalese societies? The new mediations that are needed between artworks and contemporary society must take two fundamental aspects into account. The majority of objects encapsulate a spirituality that seems alien to some modern Senegalese cultures, yet they are the connecting line in their relationship to history, given that some objects were produced by ancestors. In many societies where the spiritualities they represent are no longer alive, the heritage to be restored poses a problem: that of negotiating between identity and multiculturalism.

Its mission is to preserve and promote the cultural heritage of Senegal and Africa.

Registered since 1941, the collections now number over 9,000 items, according to a 2005 inventory, and cover a geographical area well beyond West Africa. Comprising masks, statues, textiles, basketwork, pottery, leather, metal and composite pieces, they are impressive in their diversity and quality.

Based on this exceptional heritage, the museum has put in place a mediation policy supported by the creation of a pedagotheque designed to develop the imagination, leadership and creativity of the youngest visitors. This programme is reinforced by collaboration with artists in a series of residencies designed to strengthen the link between historical heritage and contemporary creation.

An Essay by Caroline Gueye    
 

The encyclopedia universalis gives the following definitions: 
- a concrete thing that can be seen or touched
- a solid thing that is assigned to a specific use
- a subject, which presents itself to thought ("object of reflection") - which is the cause or motive ("to be an object of curiosity") - goal of an action, of an effort, of a desire, of a will
- by extension, the substance, the theme, the subject of an action  

These definitions from the encyclopedia universalis perfectly describe the work done by Viyé Diba, his exploration of forms, his practice of knowing natural, raw, organic materials, ... strategies of mediation and visualization of historical and contemporary heritages.

Another definition found is that an object is a "tangible and visible entity; concrete thing that produces shadow."

 
Seeing the objects


But how do we see these objects, to begin with. Those objects that would be invisible without light. If we are in a room lit by an artificial light: a lamp, and we turn off the light, then we are in the dark. We don't see anything anymore. Why is that? Because we are not luminous objects. In fact, almost everything around us is non-luminous (tables, chairs, ...). On the contrary, light bulbs, the sun, the stars are luminous objects. The reason why we can see the non-luminous objects around us is the reflection of light. For example, the moon is non-luminous, but we see it because of the reflection of the sun. The sun is a luminous entity which produces its own light thanks to nuclear reactions which take place in its core. It was first thanks to the light of the sun that we could be created, and then see the objects that surround us. It is thanks to this light that the Neanderthal man, 80 000 years ago, with the help of a flint and a piece of tinder, domesticated fire. And one thing leading to another, it is thanks to this that we have arrived at the ancient statues that are exhibited in the Musée Theodore Monod. Thanks to the light.

A whole history permeates the objects, not only the history that we know and that we want to communicate well – on the message that the objects transmit, their manufacture, their journey –, but the intrinsic history of these objects.

The wood in which they are conceived, or the metal or other material coming from the earth. We all come from stardust, including these objects. Since the 90's Viyé Diba has been in dialogue with the objects of the collection of the Musée Théodore Monod. This residency is in fact not the first time he has established this type of dialogue. At that time he decided on four working principles: the role of the material in the final result, the rules of composition, verticality and the question of rhythm. He created his concept from his analysis of these works.

 
Working with Viyé Diba

 

My work on the artwork that Viyé Diba realized in the frame of the residency, in addition to the exchanges with him, was a video and photographic documentation of the working process. Indeed, his concept was based on the details, the graphics of the object chosen in the collection of the Musée Théodore Monod.

I used microscopic photography to take pictures. This type of photography consists in fact of a very simple way to realize a microscope enlargement with a smartphone and a magnifying glass. Indeed, when you use only the zoom of the smartphone too close to the object, the image is completely blurred. With the help of the magnifying glass and the zoom you get an enlarged image like a microscope, a binocular or a macro lens. This work shows the details of the structures, and how sophisticated our heritage is. We realize how essential these details are for the final result. Isn't it said that the devil is in the details? The study of the details also makes it possible to realize that the role of the material is essential. The medium contributes to the purpose of the work.

And that, according to Viyé Diba, is very African. And I quote: "If you see how we make wood, we attack it, we dig, we make holes, the wood reacts, and this reaction is part of the final language of the work. All this aggression participates in the expression, participates in the final aesthetic result. The material participates in the definition of the work" and that, according to Viyé Diba, is very important.

 
The language of objects


Viyé Diba says that objects speak, have memories, ... and that they fall into disuse. The contemporary artist, I quote, “becomes the mediator to create a bridge between these objects and the population that is interested in them”. And thus there would be object:

- the 1st language is that of the materials,

- the 2nd language that of the forms,

- the 3rd language that of the museum object, its history,

- the 4th language that of the artist who creates a new narrative from the analysis of these objects,

- and finally, the language of the visitor and his reception of the contemporary work

- as well as that of the museum artwork.

 
Would there be a communion of languages?
 

Viyé Diba thinks that creation is a compromise between the material, the medium and the human sensitivity. One cannot create beyond the material. He says that one must first understand wood to be able to work with it. That metal is something else, fabric is something else, each material has a certain number of languages that must be understood and worked with, and that is why he says that objects speak. Viyé Diba's work is a bridge between the visitor and the museum work. He says that our relationship with the aesthetic is functional and spiritual and that it is possible to create a new aesthetic.

 
Development, modernization, recreated matter


In his work, Viyé also makes a distinction between development and modernization. For Viyé Diba, development does not mean modernization in the absolute. Modernization can be imported but development is created. We are in a logic of building modernization not development. The development would be an answer to our needs. He thinks that the Africans were developed in relation to their needs. And he established a reflection on the reasons of our “underdevelopment” that I will let him evolve.

Based on these paradigms, should modernity be seen as a return to our identity? Would an awareness of our reality be achieved through the way objects are made? Should we think according to the logic of modernization, rather than a logic of development, to be able to meet our real needs?

The process of Viyé Diba consists in a passage between the material which exists and the recreated material. He creates a new material, a textile using natural elements: from fibers to dye. His work not only reminds us of these ancestral and natural materials that were used daily to wash, such as bags, fabrics and which fall into disuse in favor of electric brushes for the body, fabrics made in China, plastic bags and other synthetic processes. In these elements that intertwine in his process, there is this idea of weft. He will reconstruct from the wefts a new fabric and crumple it, in order to create his material structure. He worked with tailors and carpenters to realize his work, of whom he says that they are people who experience the materials, who give the materials their language, these materials do speak. For him, this is very important.

 
Mediation


Viyé tests strategies of mediation and visualization of historical and contemporary heritages. He asks questions about people who want to build Africa, about questions of identity that come up in the current context of global pandemic. He thinks that people go into the past, into their own history, to look for elements of the future. According to him, this is what is at stake. During this residency in the framework of "Talking Objects Lab", this focus on contemporary art with ancient heritage would have as its mission, and here I quote Malick: "to challenge society, so that it learns to reread the past through the present and the artists. Here the work of the artist will be simply the work of a mediator. A mediator to speak about an old heritage that people would apprehend better, through new windows, new readings, a new glance ".`
